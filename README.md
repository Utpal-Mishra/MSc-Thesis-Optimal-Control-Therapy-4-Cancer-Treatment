## Acknowledgements
Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. James Herterich for allowing me to perform research and work on a topic of interest. Secondly, I express my deepest gratitude to my module coordinator, Prof. Lennon Ó Náraigh, for his persistent support and guidance throughout this project despite all the challenges. Without whom, I couldn’t have made it this far, especially with my dissertation. Additionally, I appreciate the panellists' questions during the presentation, helping enhance my vision of the project.

## Abstract
Proper diagnostics and administration are essential in medical examination and treatment, especially in cancer treatment. The variability in human responses to drug administration necessitates a patient-specific dosage regimen. This thesis discusses the mathematical formulation necessary to integrate drug absorption and its effects on cancer cells. A cycle of drug dosage is suggested for initial observation, and the research emphasizes the importance of control therapy, specifically Chemotherapy, utilizing a Pharmacokinetic (PK) model to optimize drug dosing tailored for individual cancer patients.
